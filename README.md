# CS5201FinalProject
The final project for Price's CS5201 course, Object Oriented Numerical Modeling, affectionately referred to as C++ for Ninjas.

The goal of this project was to model a set of second-order partial differential equations with an iterative solution, using an Object Oriented matrix class that we had been building for the duration of the semester.
